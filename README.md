# Bioinformatics Assignment 4 â€“ Part 1

##  What the project does

This project performs data analysis on two biological datasets using R.  
It focuses on gene expression and tree growth, applying data wrangling, mathematical operations, and visualization techniques. The goal is to explore biological patterns and practice reproducible coding in RStudio.



##  What files are included

- `part1.Rmd`: RMarkdown script containing all code and explanations  
- `part1.pdf`: Final knitted report in PDF format  
- `README.md`: This documentation file



##  How to run the code

1. Open `part1.Rmd` in RStudio  
2. Ensure `gene_expression.tsv` and `growth_data.csv` are in the same folder  
3. Click **Knit â†’ Knit to PDF** to generate the report  
4. All required packages (e.g. `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`) are loaded within the script  
5. Each code chunk is commented to explain its purpose and logic
